# About the project
This is a small store made using Micro-Frontends architecture. The goal was to learn more about the usage of Module federations and Webpack. Was made with React/ Typescript / Framer Motion / Chakra UI.
The design was made by [basement-studio](https://basement.studio/). I gave it life.
